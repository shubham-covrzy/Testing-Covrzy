                                    WC policy, also known as Workersâ€™ Compensation Insurance, is an insurance policy that offers coverage when any unprecedented event causes injury or loss of life of the companyâ€™s employees when working onsite. Typically, the workmen compensation insurance policy is mandated by the government with the objective to provide financial aid to the employees and restrict the potential of any upcoming lawsuit.  
                                </p>

                                <p>Workmen compensation insurance policy provides not just financial support for the employees but also secures the employers / businesses in the event of any lawsuit by employees due to injury. When businesses opt for non-compensation, it can depreciate the employee's confidence and tarnish the reputation of the company. </p>

                                <p>Workmenâ€™s Compensation insurance, also known as Employee Compensation Insurance, is mandated by the government and follows the guidelines according to the Employeeâ€™s Compensation Act, 1923. The law iterates that any employee whether working as full-time, contractual, part-time or casual employees are liable to compensation when injured due to an accident while performing duties. The act categorizes the coverage based on the severity of the injury and has a distinct compensation amount varying according to severity and impact of the accident and the salary of the workers.

                                        WC Policy is an integral policy for businesses as mandated by the government, securing not just the employees from unforeseen events with a safety net, but also supports the employers with financial security and lawsuits. Businesses can purchase Workmen Compensation Policy online as well as online by selecting best quotes from insurers.

                                        Once the policy is activated, the workers are insured for any accidents leading to injury, illness, disability or death. When such an event occurs, the injured employee must immediately report to the employer. This gives the employer the push to begin the claims process, and intimate the insurer about such an accident and the extent of injury. Further, the employer should proceed with relevant documentation which includes injured employeeâ€™s records on attendance, employment history, accident report, and all the bills disclosing the medical expenses. The insurer may verify the documents to begin the claims process for WC policy, and appoint an investigator to review the claims and verify the following:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>

                                            <h3>The medical records of the employee and the status of treatment. </h3>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <h3>The employment history, employerâ€™s report and other relevant documents. </h3>
                                        </li>

                                    <p>
                                        After verifying the documents and reviewing the condition of the injured employee, the insurer takes the call to approve the claim and divulge the coverage limit which aligns with the policy and the extent of accident. The exact amount of compensation is determined adhering to the Workmenâ€™s Compensation Rules, 1924[1], based on the conditions of injured employees from illness, permanent disability, temporary disability or loss of life.

                                        For buying Workmen Compensation Policy online or offline, it is important to consider certain factors when finalizing the premium price. Typically, the risk potential of the business and record of prior claims issued by injured employees are important factors. The premium price can also be influenced by the type of business. For example, a factory or manufacturing unit with large equipment and inventory will have a higher premium given the higher chances of injury to the employees. The common factors that shape the premium price for WC policy are: <br />
