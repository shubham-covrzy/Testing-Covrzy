                                    Commercial general liability (also known as General Commercial Insurance) is an insurance policy which offers coverage for any damages or losses caused to third person or property due to operations or activities within the business premises which is insured. This includes third party product and public liability. 
                                </p>

                                        Generally, all businesses are prone to liability risks and have a probability to cause un-intentional harm. Commercial general insurance is imperative for certain industries like food and beverages, cosmetics and other beauty products, pharma, real estate companies, and manufacturing sectors where there are high chances of injury or damage. Further, service-based businesses, such as transport agencies, construction companies, and healthcare services also have liability risks. With a CGL insurance policy, businesses get the required financial security with cover for legal costs, and verdict settlement for lawsuits initiated by impacted third parties. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The businesses with CGL policy demonstrate strong commitment and preparedness for unprecedented risks. This is not only efficient risk management but also builds credibility of the company. Furthermore, with the rising claims on injury or loss caused within the insured property premises, it might impact the reputation of the company and also cause personal injury like slander or defamation. CGL policy ensures businesses have a professional reputation and minimize liability claims. Several organizations may have a mandatory clause to only work with businesses having commercial general insurance, making it important for contractual obligations. With a CGL policy, businesses can safeguard from the heavy compensatory amounts, protect the company assets, and prevent any reputational damage due to third-party claims causing crisis situations.

                                        general liability insurance since it
                                        helps shield them from the financial
                                        effects of unforeseen liability claims.

                                        General Commercial Insurance is a type of liability insurance policy that provides coverage for any physical injury to a third party or property damage or any claims arising from it. When any unprecedented event occurs inducing insured to raise a claim under commercial general liability policy, the most immediate task should be to update the insurance company about the accident. Further, aggregate all the documents together with evidence of the damage (photographs, records of witnesses present and any official documents). When all the documents and forms related to initiating claims are submitted, the insurer will conduct an investigation to assess the damages and required compensatory amount. After the review, the insurer makes the final call to accept or reject the claims, and the coverage amount in case the claims for general commercial insurance are valid and eligible for settlement.

                                        location of the business, and the level

                                        also play a role in determining the cost
